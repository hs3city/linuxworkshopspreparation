sudo ls

du --help

sudo du --max-depth=1 -hx /

• --maxdepth=1: Just go down one level from / and sum up everything recursively underneath in the tree.
• -h: Give human-readable numbers (KB, MB, GB).
• -x Stay on one filesystem; don’t look at directories that are not on the / partition. In this case that means ignore:
     /dev /proc /run /sys
because these are pseudo-filesystems which exist in memory only; they are just empty mount points when the system is not running.
